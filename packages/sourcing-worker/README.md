## Description

NestJS worker service for real estate sourcing with BullMQ job queue integration.

## Features

- BullMQ-based job queue system
- Redis integration for queue backend
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Bull Board dashboard for queue monitoring
- Two job queues:
  - `SOURCE_FAILING_COMPANIES_REQUESTED` - Process sourcing of failing companies
  - `SOURCE_COMPANY_BUILDINGS` - Process sourcing of company buildings from files

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Docker & Docker Compose (for Redis and PostgreSQL)

## Project setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
$ pnpm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
$ cp ../../.env.example .env
```

3. Start Docker services (Redis & PostgreSQL):
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Environment Variables

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://linkinvest:linkinvest@localhost:5432/linkinvest
PORT=8080
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run dev

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

### Enqueue Jobs

- `POST /jobs/failing-companies` - Enqueue a job to source failing companies
- `POST /jobs/company-buildings` - Enqueue a job to source company buildings
  ```json
  {
    "sourceFile": "path/to/file.csv"
  }
  ```

### Bull Board Dashboard

Access the queue monitoring dashboard at: `http://localhost:8080/admin/queues`

## Architecture

- `src/database/` - Database module with Drizzle ORM
- `src/bullmq/` - BullMQ module with queue providers and service
- `src/workers/` - Worker services that process jobs
- `src/app.controller.ts` - REST endpoints for enqueueing jobs
- `src/main.ts` - Application bootstrap with Bull Board integration

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

Sources failing companies data for a specific department since a given date.

**Required Parameters:**
- `departmentId` (number): French department code (e.g., 75 for Paris)
- `sinceDate` (string): Filter records since this date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jobs/failing-companies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "departmentId": 75,
    "sinceDate": "2024-01-01"
  }'
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "12345",
  "message": "Job enqueued successfully"
}
```

### 2. Company Buildings Job

Sources company buildings from a CSV file.

**Required Parameters:**
- `sourceFile` (string): Path to the CSV file containing company data

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jobs/company-buildings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "sourceFile": "/path/to/companies.csv"
  }'
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "12346",
  "message": "Job enqueued successfully"

```bash
# Basic request (defaults to F and G energy classes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jobs/energy-sieves \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "departmentId": 75,
    "sinceDate": "2024-01-01"
  }'

# With custom energy classes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jobs/energy-sieves \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "departmentId": 75,
    "sinceDate": "2024-01-01",
    "energyClasses": ["E", "F", "G"]
  }'
```

### Monitoring Jobs

Once a job is enqueued, you can monitor its progress using the Bull Board dashboard:

```
http://localhost:8080/admin/queues
```

The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of:
- Job status (waiting, active, completed, failed)
- Job logs and errors
- Queue metrics and statistics
- Ability to retry failed jobs
